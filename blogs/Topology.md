# Topology
Topology is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations, such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. It emerged through the development of concepts from geometry and set theory, such as space, dimension, and transformation. Here are some of the concepts in topology that I find interesting.

> this blog is a summary of the video Topology, Manifolds & Differential Geometry by WHYB maths. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxBAVPVHJPcrNrcEBKbqC_ykiVqfxZgNl).

## What is a Topological Space?
A topological space is a set with topology.

For example:
1. a circle is a $S^1$ topological space
2. a sphere is a $S^2$ topological space
3. a torus (donut) is a $S^1 \times S^1$ or $T^2$ topological space

4. polyhedra are topological spaces

5. a Möbius strip is a topological space

6. a Klein bottle is a topological space

## What is a Topological Invariant?
To distinguish between different topological spaces, we use topological invariants. A topological invariant is a property of a topological space that is invariant under homeomorphisms. Homeomorphisms are continuous functions between topological spaces that have continuous inverses.

If we say two topological spaces are "the same" in terms of topology, we mean that we can smoothly deform one into the other without tearing or gluing.

For example, a cirle is the same as a square in terms of topology, because we can deform a square into a circle.
