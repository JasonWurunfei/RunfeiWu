# Makefile
I found this super nice blog I thought I need to share it.

The blog is about Makefile here is the link: [Makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com/)

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I don't plan to write a blog about Makefile since this one is so good unless I find something that is not covered in this blog.

## premake
I found this tool that is used to generate Makefile, Visual Studio, and Xcode project files. I have not tried it yet but it looks promising. Here is the link: [premake](https://premake.github.io/)
